              <p>Since the beginning, Sub for Santa has always been a community-based and funded entity. The Cache County Sub for Santa first served the community from the Senior Center on 1st East in Logan. As the organization continued to serve, it has operated out of the Whittier Center, the Boys and Girls Club, and recently, the BATC West Campus building. Year after year, the Cache County Sub for Santa continues to bring assistance to individuals and families in need during the Christmas season.</p>
              <p>Cache County Sub for Santa is a non-profit 501(c) 3 organization.</p>
